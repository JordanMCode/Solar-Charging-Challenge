label each row w/ column numbers for each different button submit. 
On click submit iterate through the array until it finds and empty slot. 
if empty, append the user input into the empty space. 

Submit all button instead of individual submits. This will cut down on a lot of code and avoid incorrect placements of data. Validate to make sure all fields are filled in. Create an array with each row as an object.

Refactor later to cut down validation code. Use or (||) statements for 'blank input' alert.
